# STEMDL classification benchmark

## 1.Introduction

This folder contains the Pytorch-Lightning implementation of STEMDL classification, developed at STFC.
The STEMDL classification benchmark represents a machine learning model which can classify CBED patterns obtained 
from crystals into one of the 230 crystallographic space groups. The benchmark uses resnet50, it is written in Pytorch Lightning 
and enables distributed learning on multiple GPUs. The source code is a single Python program "stemdl_classification.py" 
which reads the configuration file "stemdlConfig.yaml" containing the values of parameters. The sequence of steps 
performed by the benchmark can be described as follows:
1. read the configuration file ("stemdlConfig.yaml")
2. read the datasets from the training, validation, testing and inference directories as specified in "stemdlConfig.yaml"
3. train the model
4. test the model
4. perform inferencing
5. measure the time of trainig per epoch and time of a single inference operation
6. save the time measurements in "log_file" (see stemdlConfig.yaml)
7. save MLCOmmons logging in "mlperf_logfile" (see stemdlConfig.yaml)

## 2.Datasets

Before running the benchmark all datasets must be downloaded from the remore server. The dataset used by the benchmark 
is about `35` GB which is split into four folders: training (`28` GB, `148006` files), validation (`3.8` GB, `20401` files), 
testing (`1.8` GB, `9374` files) and inference (`1.8` GB, `9375` files).

The datasets can be downloaded from remote server by using this command:
aws s3 --no-sign-request --endpoint-url https://s3.echo.stfc.ac.uk sync s3://sciml-datasets/ms/stemdl_ds1a ./

The target directory in this case is the local one "./", but any other directory path with a write permission can also be 
provided.  As a result of the aws command four directories will be created: training, testing, validation and inference.

## 3.Installation

It is recommended to run the Stemdl benchmark in the Anaconda environment.

1. If Anaconda is not already installed on the system, it can be downloaded from
 here:
   `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh`

2. Install Anaconda
   `bash Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh`

3. Create conda environment
  `conda create --name bench python=3.8`

4. Activate environment
   `conda activate bench`

5. `pip install pytorch-lightning`

6. `pip install torchvision`

7. `pip install scikit-learn`
 
8. For installing the MLCommons logging library please follow the instructions at `https://github.com/mlcommons/logging`

9. `git clone https://github.com/mlperf/logging.git mlperf-logging`

10. `pip install -e mlperf-logging`

## 4.Running the benchmark

`python sytemdl_classification.py --config stemdlConfig.yaml`
